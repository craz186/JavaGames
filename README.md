JavaGames
=========

Small games recreated in Java, may not work fully but main idea works. 

I am a 3rd year student studying computer science.

These games are just for fun and are my interpretation of how these games were made.
Feel free to re-use any code in this repository to help further your knowledge of Java. 
I do not claim to be an expert and I'm sure some programs may be extremely inefficient 
or use bad programming practices so please be aware of this if you do try to learn from
anything I have created.

Any ideas or requests for little games to be made feel free to contact me at
